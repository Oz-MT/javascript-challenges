//? Develop a guessing game. Randomly generate a number between 0-100. Ask the user to guess that number.
//? The user should have 5 chance to guess the number.
//? If the number entered by the user:
//? is greater than the random number then warn user to decrease,
//? is less than the random number then warn user to increase,
//? is equal to the random number then congratulate the user and tell in how many guesses were used to find the number
//? If user canâ€™t find the number in 5 guess then game is lost and display the random number.
//? Hint: you can use this code to generate random number 0-100
//? const winingNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * 100);
